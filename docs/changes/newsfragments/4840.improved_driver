Two parameters are added to the `Keysight.N51x1` class, conditioned on it having the 'UNW' option:
    1. Having the pulse modulation status on or off.
    2. Setting it to 'internal' or 'external'.

From the Keysight manual:
    1. This command enables or disables pulse modulation for the selected path.
    2. This command sets the source of the pulse modulation.
